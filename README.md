# OpenCVObjectFollowerBot
This repository contains the code for an object-following robot using OpenCV. The robot is designed to track and follow a specific object in its surroundings using computer vision techniques provided by the OpenCV library.
#Features
Real-time object tracking: The robot utilizes OpenCV's object detection and tracking algorithms to locate and track a specified object in real-time.
Autonomous movement: Based on the object's position in the camera frame, the robot autonomously adjusts its movement to keep the object in the center of the frame.
User-friendly interface: The code provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily configure the object to be tracked, camera settings, and control the robot's behavior.
